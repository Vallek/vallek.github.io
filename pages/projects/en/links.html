<h1 class="page__heading">Frontend links compilation</h1>
<p class="page__text">Over the years of practice and teaching, I have collected a lot of useful materials. I share this collection of links with my students. The selection is updated periodically. I remove the outdated, add new links and entire sections.</p>
<p class="page__text">It's also not just a bonus. Knowledge sharing is an essential part of education and any profession. This compilation has become a full-fledged project that I continue to update, support and add features.</p>
<h2>You can check compilation yourself:</h2>
