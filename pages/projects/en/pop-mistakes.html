<h1 class="page__heading">Popular Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h1>
<p class="page__text">This is a webinar about popular beginner's mistakes. I meet a lot of different students from different education organizations. Many of them make the same mistakes. The purpose of this webinar is to help them learn how to find, correct and avoid these mistakes.</p>
<p class="page__text">The webinar examines both most common novice mistakes (relative paths, invalid code, typos) and layout errors (height restriction, using position for layout).</p>
<p class="page__text">In addition to the mistakes, students will learn how to avoid them. And also how to analyze the problem by themselves and find a solution by asking yourself necessary questions.</p>
<p class="page__text">Held this lecture at SkillFactory and at my course.</p>
