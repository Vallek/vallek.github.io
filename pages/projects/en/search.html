<h1 class="page__heading">How to search info on frontend</h1>
<p class="page__text">
	In my education practice, I often meet students who underestimate the importance of looking for information on your own.
</p>
<p class="page__text">
	This lecture is intended to explain to beginners why it is important to learn how to look for info, what sites you can trust and what sites you shouldn't and how to do it effectively and efficiently. These are the knowledge and approaches that I myself use every day and without it I would not be able to achieve any professional progress.
</p>
<p class="page__text">
	This lecture was created primarily for frontend devs, but with minor changes it is applicable to other developer professions. I have successfully read it for mobile developers, testers and backend devs.
