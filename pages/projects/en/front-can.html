<h1 class="page__heading">Webinar "What a Frontend Developer Can Do"</h1>
<p class="page__text">The goal of this webinar is to introduce newcomers to fronend developer work and to attract them to continue the course. As opposed to the full course where everything is explained from ground up, this webinar is jumping right into the interesting stuff - practice.</p>
<p class="page__text">Students will get familiar with figma workflow, HTML, CSS (including animations) and a little bit of JS. They will learn how to use Github Pages as hosting and will be able to consider if they would like working as frontend developer themselves.</p>
<p class="page__text">Duration: about 3,5 hours with answers and a breaks. Could be divided into two parts.</p>
