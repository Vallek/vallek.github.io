<h1 class="page__heading">Work at Socio-economic Institute and Social development center</h1>
<h3 class="job__heading">Author and teacher (2017)</h3>
<p class="job__text">Created and held a HTML/CSS, Photoshop and computer literacy courses. Worked with students with disabilities.</p>
<h2>Achievements</h2>
<p class="page__text">This was my first teaching experience (except for the practice at the university) and I immediately created three of my own courses. At the same time, I had almost complete freedom in terms of content, which is a plus, but it doesn't make the job easier:) I simultaneously (different days during a week) taught two or three different courses with different face-to-face groups. It was a pretty rewarding experience.</p>
<h2>What I learned on this job</h2>
<p class="page__text">I worked with groups from the labor exchange. And I understood this audience very well, because I myself went through a change of profession at a not very young age. I wanted to help people with this kind of problems and give them a quality education (while I myself came across not very high quality ones). </p>
<p class="page__text">Off course not everything was successful. I would do a lot of things differently now. Less success, it seems to me, I have achieved in the Center for Social Support for People with Disabilities. Mostly because of the wrong approach and little experience. In addition, many there treated the courses more as leisure (which is also more of a organization problem). But since then, I have learned a lot and now I would conduct such courses in a different way.</p>
