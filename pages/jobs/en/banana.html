<h1 class="page__heading">Work at Digital Banana</h1>
<h3 class="job__heading">Author and teacher (2020)</h3>
<p class="job__text">Created and taught a frontend course for high school students. Checked homework practice.</p>
<h2>Achievements</h2>
<p class="page__text">I wanted to teach high school and college students. I usually work with older people, many of whom want to change careers. Often, in addition to learning skills, both the students themselves and the teacher have to deal with the shortcomings of the previous education. Therefore, I wanted to help those who are just starting their professional journey to avoid these problems and learn more effectively right away.</p>
<h2>What I learned on this job</h2>
<p class="page__text">Communication with another, younger generation allows you to take a different look at the learning process and its tasks. At the same time, young people have a greater desire to learn. Adults seem to be more likely to expect that they will just passively learn everything.</p>
