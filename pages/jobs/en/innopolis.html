<h2>Achievements</h2>
<p class="job__text">This is the biggest and most in-depth course that I ever created at the time of this work. It consists of two stages and includes the basics of HTML/CSS, two templates (training and real one), the beginning of JS, getting to know the backend/CMS and other additional lessons with a deeper dive into the frontend. Additional topics include static generators, BEM, Git, and more.</p>
<h2>What I learned on this job</h2>
<p class="job__text">For the first time, I designed a course according to rather strict state requirements.</p>
