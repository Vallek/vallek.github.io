<h3 class="job__heading">Teacher (2022)</h3>
<p class="job__text">Taught part of a frontend course.</p>
<p class="job__text">I replaced the teacher, who could not continue the work. Conducted 4 classes on the remaining topics for students (CSS grid, animation). Also conducted a live diplomas check at the final lesson. This was my first experience as a "substitute teacher" :) I had to quickly adjust my material to a ready-made plan and immediately look for a common language with previously unknown students.</p>
<p class="job__text">For the first time I worked with a foreign (Belarusian) company.</p>
